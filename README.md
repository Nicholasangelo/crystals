I've never been to Crystal's Taco Shed before.  How big are the portions? how much should I order? I am STARVING, But I hope I don't order too much and bust a gut!

How to Play:
- Crystal's Taco Menu has four options:
    Hard, Soft, Grilled, and Bowl
- each one has a randomly generated number of "filling points"
- keeping an eye on you "fullness level" try to perfectly fill your gut by ordering one taco at a time
- careful not to order too much!

this game was developed with Html, Css, and Javascript.
